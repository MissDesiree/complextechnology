# Why Complex Technology Makes Us Less Safe

As an IT student passionate about cybersecurity, I’m learning how much our digital safety depends on understanding the systems we use every day. Here’s a simple breakdown of why complex technology can actually make us less secure and what we can do about it.
Today, we use technology for almost everything: banking, shopping, talking to friends, and even turning off the lights at home. These tools make life easier and faster. But here’s the problem: the more features technology has, the harder it is to keep safe.
This is what experts mean when they say complexity is the enemy of security.
When something is complex, it has many parts. For example, your phone has apps, an operating system, settings, and internet access. Each part contains code written by humans and humans make mistakes. A mistake in the code is called a security bug or vulnerability. These bugs are like small holes in a wall that hackers can sneak through.
When hackers find these bugs, they can:
Steal your personal information


Install viruses or malware


Lock your files and demand money (this is called ransomware)


Take over your computer or phone


So why don’t we just fix them? Many bugs do get fixed through patches or updates. But not everyone installs updates right away. Some people ignore them or don’t know they’re important.
Also, because tech keeps changing, new bugs appear all the time. It’s like fixing a leaky boat while new holes keep popping up.
Another issue: some hackers don’t even need skills. They can buy exploit kits tools that help break into systems using known bugs. If your device isn’t updated, it becomes an easy target.
For example, a hacker might use a kit to attack an old version of Internet Explorer. Just clicking a bad link or visiting the wrong site could infect your device without you knowing.
So, what can we do?
Here are some simple steps:
Keep devices updated. Install updates right away.


Be careful online. Don’t click on unknown links.


Avoid sketchy files/apps. Use trusted sources only.


Use antivirus software. It can catch threats early.


Back up your files. So you don’t lose everything.


Cybersecurity is like a race between the good guys and the bad guys. Right now, the bad guys have the upper hand because technology keeps getting more complex. But if we stay alert and take action, we can make it harder for hackers to win.
I’d love to hear from you:
 Do you update your devices regularly? What tools or habits do you use to stay safe online?
Let’s help each other grow in this digital world.
